The first one,\n        biodegradability, is pretty obvious; the substance should break down naturally over time so\n        that it doesn’t end up in a landfill. The next few may sound a bit intimidating, but when it\n        comes down to it, we’re just looking for something that can absorb excess moisture, is heat\n        tolerant, and can perform well under stress (i.e. it isn’t brittle), respectively.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.section}>\n        I’m going to tell you about 3 food packaging alternatives that meet these requirements:\n        <strong> hydrogel, chitosan, and agar</strong>.

Hydrogels are sometimes described as “smart”,\n            meaning that they can quickly respond to their environment and react by increasing or\n            decreasing hydration levels. This decrease in water activity is essential as it slows\n            down the growth rate of mold, yeast, and other bacteria. It can also decrease the\n            softening of crispy items such as chips or biscuits. The takeaway here is that moisture\n            control is very important in prolonging shelf life, and hydrogels just so happen to be\n            pretty good at that.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>\n              <em>Thermal properties.</em>\n            </strong>{' '}\n            As mentioned above, hydrogels are what we call “smart”, and this extends into its\n            thermal properties as well. In addition to the ability to react to stimuli like pH\n            levels, hydrogels can also react to increases/decreases in temperature and respond\n            accordingly.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        All of these properties come together to help hydrogels achieve what is called{' '}\n        <strong>active food packaging</strong> - packaging that interacts directly with the\n        contained food product to reduce microbial growth and extend shelf life.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.section}>\n        So these hydrogels sound great, right? They’re good at keeping your food fresher for longer,\n        help slow the growth of any bacteria, and they aren’t bad for the environment - what could\n        go wrong? Unfortunately, there is one pretty significant concern when it comes to these\n        super polymers: <strong>disintegration</strong>. The very same hydratability that makes\n        hydrogels so great is also its worst enemy; hydrogels can sometimes reach what is called an\n        <strong> equilibrium swelling level</strong>, in which case they can begin to dissolve. This\n        isn’t very common, but it’s kind of a big problem. You wouldn’t want to get your food home\n        and find that its packaging has completely disintegrated.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.section}>\n        This is where synthetic hydrogels would help us out - we can tweak them just enough to\n        minimize the chance for disintegration while maximizing swelling capabilities, allowing for\n        full optimization.\n      </Typography>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/chitosan.78907e47.png\";","import React from 'react'\n\nimport Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography'\n\nimport chitosan from '../img/chitosan.png'\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles'\n\nconst useStyles = makeStyles(() => ({\n  title: {\n    padding: 20,\n    fontSize: 22,\n    fontWeight: 'bolder',\n    textAlign: 'center',\n    fontFamily: 'Rokkit',\n  },\n  section: {\n    textAlign: 'justify',\n    padding: '10px 70px',\n  },\n  imgContainer: {\n    display: 'flex',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n  },\n  img: {\n    width: '80%',\n    margin: 50,\n  },\n}))\n\nexport default function Chitosan() {\n  const classes = useStyles()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Typography className={classes.title}>Chitosan</Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.section}>\n        Chitosan is mainly isolated from <strong>crustacean waste</strong> and is the{' '}\n        <strong>second most abundant polysaccharide (carbohydrate) in the world.</strong> It can be\n        used in a similar way that hydrogels are used, by casting it into a film that will\n        eventually be wrapped around the food.

Its derivation into a food\n        packaging alternative is a bit different from chitosan and hydrogels, though.

In terms of the four qualities that any food packaging alternative\n        should have, agar really only checks off the “biodegradability” box.

If agar was naturally yellow or brown, it probably wouldn’t be very\n            attractive when wrapped around your food. More importantly, though, is that the\n            transparency allows the consumer to see the state of their food better than if it were\n            wrapped in translucent plastic.

I\n        know what you’re thinking:\n        <em> why is this even an option then if it has nothing we’re looking for?</em> And that’s a\n        good point.
