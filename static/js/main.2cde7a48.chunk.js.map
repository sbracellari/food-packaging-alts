Knowing what we know about\n            plastic now, you’re probably thinking to yourself - “50 years? That has to be so bad for\n            our environment!” - and you wouldn’t be wrong. But, hindsight is 20/20, and at the time,\n            plastic was the most practical and economical option. Practical because it’s extremely\n            readily available, and economical because it costs almost nothing to use.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            You might be wondering why the industry started using plastic in the first place. The\n            simple answer is that there was an increased demand from consumers for fresher and safer\n            food, which led to the increased use of plastic as a way to package that food. It makes\n            sense; if the people want a longer shelf life for their food, and you have this material\n            that is safe, low cost, and readily available, you would use it, too. But like I said,\n            hindsight is 20/20, and we know now that plastic really isn’t the best option for food\n            packaging when it comes to our environment.\n          </Typography>\n          <div style={{ padding: 70 }}>\n            <img style={{ width: '100%' }} src={plastic} alt='fruit in plastic bag' />\n          </div>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            Think about how much plastic packaging you are removing from your food on a weekly basis\n            - it’s probably a lot. Our fruits are boxed in it, our snacks are bagged in it, and our\n            meats are wrapped in it. And whether that plastic goes to the trash bin or the recycling\n            bin, some of it will inevitably end up in a landfill, because plastic is neither 100%\n            recyclable nor biodegradable. This is obviously not great for our planet, and\n            fortunately, we’ve come to realize that. Upward trending spikes in petroleum prices and\n            increased knowledge about how unhealthy plastic use is for the environment has left us\n            searching for alternatives.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            There are a few criteria that must be met when choosing a food packaging alternative\n            (this is assuming that the chosen substance is food-safe, for obvious reasons):\n            generally, we want to choose something that is biodegradable and has promising swelling,\n            thermal, and mechanical properties. The first one, biodegradability, is pretty obvious;\n            the substance should break down naturally over time so that it doesn’t end up in a\n            landfill. The next few may sound a bit intimidating, but when it comes down to it, we’re\n            just looking for something that can absorb excess moisture, is heat tolerant, and can\n            perform well under stress (i.e. it isn’t brittle), respectively.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            I’m going to tell you about 3 food packaging alternatives that meet these requirements:\n            hydrogel, chitosan, and agar. Some of these may sound familiar to you - and that’s\n            because they’re pretty common substances. We’re going to explore the ways in which these\n            substances are used, what they’re really good at doing, and what they’re not so good at\n            doing. Let’s get right into it.\n          </Typography>\n        </div>\n        <Divider className={classes.divider} />\n        <div>\n          <Typography className={classes.section}>Hydrogels</Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            Hydrogels are hydrophilic, 3 dimensional networks of polymer chains, which is really\n            just fancy talk for a substance that can absorb a lot of liquid without any sort of\n            structural changes. Most hydrogels can absorb up to 100% of their weight in water, with\n            some superabsorbent hydrogels capable of absorbing thousands of times their dry weight.\n          </Typography>\n          <div style={{ padding: 70 }}>\n            <img style={{ width: '100%' }} src={hydrogel} alt='fruit in plastic bag' />\n          </div>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            Hydrogels can either be natural or synthetic, with the first synthetic polymers arising\n            in the early 1960s. They’re present in some pretty common, everyday items, like contact\n            lenses and diapers. But how did they find their way into the food industry? Well, to put\n            it simply, they found their way by acting as food packaging, but you already know that.\n            Essentially, hydrogels can be cast into biodegradable films and dried, allowing them to\n            act as a sort of barrier between your food and the outside world. Without going into the\n            actual casting process, it really doesn’t get more simple than that.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            So why do we want a hydrogelic film wrapped around our food as opposed to some plastic?\n            Well, most importantly, they’re FDA approved, so we know that they’re at least food\n            safe. But that isn’t really enough to justify them as a packaging alternative.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            Remember those criteria I mentioned earlier about what makes a good food packaging\n            alternative? Let’s talk about hydrogels in terms of those that are applicable:\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <em>Biodegradability.</em> This one is pretty straightforward. Hydrogels break down\n                naturally and wouldn’t be adding to landfills the way plastics to.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <em>Absorbability.</em> This is arguably the most important aspect of a hydrogel,\n                since it’s literal definition revolves around being super absorbent. Hydrogels are\n                sometimes described as “smart”, meaning that they can quickly respond to their\n                environment and react by increasing or decreasing hydration levels. This decrease in\n                water activity is essential as it slows down the growth rate of mold, yeast, and\n                other bacteria. It can also decrease the softening of crispy items such as chips or\n                biscuits. The takeaway here is that moisture control is very important in prolonging\n                shelf life, and hydrogels just so happen to be pretty good at that.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <em>Thermal properties.</em> As mentioned above, hydrogels are what we call “smart”,\n                and this extends into its thermal properties as well. In addition to the ability to\n                react to stimuli like pH levels, hydrogels can also react to increases/decreases in\n                temperature and respond accordingly.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            All of these properties come together to help hydrogels achieve what is called “active\n            food packaging” - packaging that interacts directly with the contained food product to\n            reduce microbial growth and extend shelf life.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            So these hydrogels sound great, right? They’re good at keeping your food fresher for\n            longer, help slow the growth of any bacteria, and they aren’t bad for the environment -\n            so what could go wrong? Unfortunately, there is one pretty significant concern when it\n            comes to these super polymers: disintegration. The very same hydratability that makes\n            hydrogels so great is also its worst enemy; hydrogels can sometimes reach what is called\n            an “equilibrium swelling level”, in which case it can begin to dissolve. This isn’t very\n            common, but it’s kind of a big problem. You wouldn’t want to get your food home and find\n            that its packaging has completely disintegrated. That probably wouldn’t make for a very\n            good day.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={classes.subsection}>\n            This is where synthetic hydrogels would help us out - we can tweak them just enough to\n            minimize the chance for disintegration while maximizing swelling capabilities, allowing\n            for full optimization.\n          </Typography>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport App from './App'\n\nconst project_name = 'food-packaging'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(project_name)\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
